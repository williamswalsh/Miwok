This app is used to aide in learning the Miwok language spoken by the native american indians.

This app is divided up into 4 categories:
+ Numbers
+ Colors

In each category there is a list of english words and their miwok translation.
Each word can be selected and the miwok translation will be heard from the android device default speaker.
Each word has a descriptive image beside it to aide in understanding of the word.(No images used in phrase category)

This app was built during the course of the Udacity Android Development Course.

Each entry is encapsulated in an Object called a Word.
The words are stored in ArrayLists, one Arrayist per category.
Each word contains an english String, a Miwok String and an Image resource id.
